# Electrical-Circuit-Simulation

## Application Summary
This application is a simulation of an electrical dc circuit using resistors or capacitors. Each tab of the application has a different setup of electrical components except the help tab. The help tab explains how the program works and the theory behind it as well as gives a legend for the circuit components. The others have sliders and textfields on the right sidebar each of which are linked to a different component in the circuit. By changing the value of either one you can set the voltage, resistance or capacitance of a given battery, resistor or capacitor. By hitting calculate the other properties of the resistors and capacitors in the circuit are calculated by making use of Ohm’s law (V = I*R & Q = C*V). In the custom tabs the user can make a circuit of their own by choosing an option from the combobox and clicking add which will then update the display of the circuit and add the corresponding circuit element to the right sidebar. 

## Teamwork Summary
	Merrick created the calcResistance method and the calcCapacitance methods; the images for the different circuit elements; and came up with the algorithm for the custom display of the circuit elements.
	Lucas created the sidebar UI where the circuit element’s properties are set, displayed and updated; the help tab; and implemented the images of the circuits and circuit elements as well as the algorithm for displaying the custom circuit elements.
